Stable prices ensure better access to nutritious vegetables, promoting food security.\nIncome & Work: Farmers face financial instability due to fluctuating prices and unpredictable demand. An idea of future vegetable prices, enhancing income stability and reducing losses.\nHealth: Unstable vegetable prices limit access to essential nutrients, affecting overall health. Predictable prices encourage consistent consumption of vegetables, improving dietary health."
